  <h2 style="text-align:center;">The Unreal Editor</h2>
  <p>Unreal Engine includes the Unreal Editor, an integrated development environment available on Linux, MacOS, and Windows for content authoring. With support for multi-user editing, artists, designers, and developers can simultaneously make changes to the same Unreal Engine project in a safe and reliable way, while the ability to run the full Unreal Editor in VR mode means you can build in a WYSIWYG environment.</p>
  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Scalable foliage</h2>
  <p>Automatically cover your huge outdoor environments with different types of grass, flowers, small rocks, or your mesh of choice using the Grass Tool, and create vast forests filled with many different kinds of trees and brushes with the Procedural Foliage Tool that simulates how a forest grows over the years.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Asset optimization</h2>
  <p>Preparing and optimizing a complex model for better real-time performance can be a tedious, time-consuming experience, often involving multiple round-trips. Unreal Engine offers tools like automatic LOD (level of detail) generation; jacketing and defeaturing, which eliminate hidden surfaces and unnecessary details; and the Proxy Geometry tool, which combines multiple meshes and their materials into a single mesh and material.</p>
  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Mesh Editing Tools</h2>
  <p>Unreal Engine includes basic mesh editing tools to correct small problems in geometry without having to fix them in the source package and re-import. Within the Static Mesh Editor, you can select faces in a variety of ways—by picking, by material, by element, or with grow/shrink—and create, delete, or flip the selected faces, or detach them to a separate new static mesh. You can also unify normals, assign a new material, and perform basic UV projections.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Benefits of Development Engines</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">A game engine, also known as a game architecture, game framework or gameframe, is a software-development environment designed for people to build video games. Developers use game engines to construct games for consoles, mobile devices, and personal computers. The core functionality typically provided by a game engine includes a rendering engine ("renderer") for 2D or 3D graphics, a physics engine or collision detection (and collision response), sound, scripting, animation, artificial intelligence, networking, streaming, memory management, threading, localization support, scene graph, and may include video support for cinematics. Implementers often economize on the process of game development by reusing/adapting, in large part, the same game engine to produce different games[1] or to aid in porting games to multiple platforms.</p>
